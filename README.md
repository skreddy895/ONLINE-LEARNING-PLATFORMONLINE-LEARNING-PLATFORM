EduSphere is a beginner-friendly online learning platform that I created as part of Task 2 during my internship at CodTech. This project is a redesigned version of a previous platform I made called CyberLearn, but EduSphere has been developed especially for a friend with a different name, layout, color scheme, and quiz content. The purpose of this project was to practice creating a complete web-based learning interface using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without using any external libraries or frameworks.

The platform includes a homepage that introduces EduSphere and highlights its features in a simple and clear layout. There's a hero section that welcomes users and explains the purpose of the platform, followed by a section showcasing the main benefits such as on-demand classes, personalized learning paths, expert support, and verified badges on course completion. I have also included a short interactive quiz with three questions that allow users to check their knowledge in a fun and engaging way. When users submit the quiz, they immediately see which answers were right or wrong, and their total score is displayed.

In addition to the quiz, there’s a login page where users can enter their email and password. The login is only for demonstration purposes and doesn’t use a backend server. If both fields are filled, a success message appears and the user is redirected to the homepage. All form handling and validation are done through vanilla JavaScript. The design is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes using pure CSS. The color theme of EduSphere is based on teal-green tones, giving it a fresh and modern appearance, different from the blue-based CyberLearn design.

Through this project, I got the opportunity to improve my understanding of JavaScript events, DOM manipulation, and responsive web design. I also learned how to structure a project and test it using just VS Code and my local terminal. EduSphere helped me apply the core concepts I’ve been learning, and I look forward to upgrading it in the future with user registration, video lessons, and backend integration. This project is a good example of how even basic tools can be used to create something useful and functional.
